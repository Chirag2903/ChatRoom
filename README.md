# Chat Room


The project is a simple real-time chat application built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. It allows users to join a chat room, send messages in real-time, and receive updates when other users join or leave the chat. The front end is implemented with HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript, while the server-side logic is handled with Node.js and Express. Socket.IO is used to enable real-time communication between the server and clients.
